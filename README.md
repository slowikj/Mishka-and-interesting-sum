The solution to [a codeforces' algorithmic task](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/703/D)
(data structures)

Task
----
We are given an array with integers.
The aim of the task is to compute for each queried interval [a, b]
the xor of the different values which occur an even number of times.

Example
----
Input:

```
6
1 1 2 3 3 4
1
1 6
```

Output:

```
2
```

(because 1 ^ 3 = 2)
